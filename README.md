# mediaLaw-f21

The project was created for the Media Law course. (Fall 2021) The purpose was to make a work that falls under a gray area of Intellectual Property law. This remixed book raises a question regarding the smallest language unit to judge copyright infringement in literature written in English. If a machine divides a novel into words and randomly rearranges them to create a new book, is it copyright infringement in a legal context?

The chosen original text was Harry Potter. (Book 1, Chapter 1 and Book 3, Chapter 2)
