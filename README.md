# mediaLaw-f21

The project was for the Media Law course. (Fall 2021) The main goal was to make a work that falls under a grey area of the Intellectual Property law. The question here is about the smallest unit of copyright protection in verbal creative works. What if a computer divides a novel into words and randomly rearranges them to create a new book? Is it still a copyright infringement?
